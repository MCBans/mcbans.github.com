We are currently experiencing a very large amount of traffic to the api and mcbans.com server. <br />
We are working 24/7 to get this resolved as soon as possible. <br />
In the meantime, if you could set your server to "/mcbans offline" in your servers. local bans should work. <br />
As for disputers, unfortunately we cannot handle disputes at this time. <br />
<br />
Sincerely.<br />
MCBans Staff<br/>

We are setting up a system with DDoS protection, but the service is pretty expensive.<br />
We will try to get the service back up as soon as possible. please make a donation if you can.<br />
